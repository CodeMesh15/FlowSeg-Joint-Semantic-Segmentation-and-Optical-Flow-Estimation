# FlowSeg-Joint-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Optical-Flow-Estimation
An implementation of "FlowSeg," a deep learning approach for simultaneous semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation from video data. This project explores advanced Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to jointly learn these two tasks.
