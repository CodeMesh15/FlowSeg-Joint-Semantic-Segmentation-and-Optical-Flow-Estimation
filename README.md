# FlowSeg-Joint-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Optical-Flow-Estimation

# 1. Project Overview
- This project aims to build a deep learning model that can simultaneously perform semantic segmentation (identifying and categorizing objects in each frame) and optical flow estimation (estimating the motion of pixels between frames). The core idea is that these two tasks are complementary; understanding motion can help delineate objects, and understanding object boundaries can improve motion estimation. This implementation is based on the "FlowSeg" project, which focused on using novel Deep CNN architectures to jointly solve these problems.


# 2. Core Objectives
- To build a deep convolutional neural network capable of joint, multi-task learning.

- To simultaneously estimate semantic segmentation masks and optical flow fields from video sequences.

- To implement a training and evaluation pipeline for this dual-task problem.

### Methodology

Our approach is broken down into four key phases: data preparation, model architecture design, joint model training, and finally, evaluation and visualization.

#### Phase 1: Dataset and Preprocessing

1.  **Dataset Selection**: This model requires a dataset with annotations for both semantic segmentation and optical flow. We will use the **KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite** or **Cityscapes**, which are standard for this type of task. Scripts will be provided to download and prepare the data (`/data/prepare_kitti.py`).
2.  **Preprocessing**: Raw data will be processed by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and correctly formatting the ground truth segmentation masks and optical flow fields.
3.  **Data Loaders**: We will implement a custom `DataLoader` in PyTorch/TensorFlow to efficiently feed pairs of consecutive frames and their corresponding ground truth labels into the model during training.

#### Phase 2: Model Architecture (The "FlowSeg" Network)

1.  **Shared Encoder**: The core of our model is a deep CNN encoder (e.g., a ResNet backbone) that processes two consecutive video frames. This encoder learns a shared feature representation that is beneficial for both tasks.
2.  **Task-Specific Decoders**: The output from the shared encoder is fed into two distinct decoder "heads":
    * **Segmentation Decoder**: This decoder uses up-sampling and transposed convolutions to take the shared features and output a semantic segmentation mask for the frame.
    * **Flow Estimation Decoder**: This decoder, inspired by architectures like FlowNet, processes the shared features to output a 2D vector field representing the optical flow between the two frames.
3.  **Implementation**: The complete architecture, reflecting the project's goal of using "advanced and novel Deep CNN architectures," will be defined in `/models/flowseg_model.py`.

#### Phase 3: Training the Joint Model

1.  **Combined Loss Function**: To train the network on two objectives simultaneously, we use a composite loss function. This function is a weighted sum of the individual losses from each task:
    `Loss_total = α * Loss_segmentation + β * Loss_flow`
    * **Segmentation Loss**: Calculated using standard Cross-Entropy loss.
    * **Flow Loss**: Calculated using the Average Endpoint Error (EPE).
    * The hyperparameters `α` and `β` are used to balance the contribution of each task.
2.  **Training Script**: The main `train.py` script will manage the training loop, which includes forward and backward passes, calculating the combined loss, and updating model weights. It will also handle metric logging and saving model checkpoints.

#### Phase 4: Evaluation and Visualization

1.  **Quantitative Evaluation**: An `evaluate.py` script will be used to assess model performance on the test set using standard metrics for each task:
    * **Segmentation**: Mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).
    * **Optical Flow**: Average Endpoint Error (AEPE).
2.  **Qualitative Visualization**: We will provide a `visualize.py` script to generate visual outputs. For a given video clip, this script will produce a side-by-side comparison of the original input, the predicted segmentation mask, and a visual representation of the predicted flow field.
